The Vibe-Coder License (VCL-0.1-Experimental)  
This license was vibe-coded. Future revisions must also be vibe-coded,  
only if it serves the vibe.

https://github.com/tyraziel/vibe-coder-license/

Permission is granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software 
for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, ONLY IF IT SERVES THE VIBE, 
subject to the following terms:

---
(Section numbers may evolve or skip as the vibe dictates.)

1) Mood, not bugs.  
   There are no bugs or issues — only mood misalignments.  

2) Contributions.  
   Contributions should be vibe-coded. Overthinking is allowed only when it 
   serves the vibe (e.g., keeping your co-viber from going rogue).  
   Pull requests are encouraged to include prompts or notes of AI use, if any.  

3) Testing.  
   Maintainers reserve the right to:  
   – stress the vibes thoroughly,  
   – vibe-check every contribution to unreasonable extremes,  
   – run the gauntlet of tests,  
   – shake the bugs loose until only vibes remain,  
   – subject code to unreasonable amounts of testing,  
   – and, of course, test the beans out of it.  

4) Attribution of Code.  
   Preserve this license text in redistributions of substantial portions.  

5) No warranties.  
   This software is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind.  
   USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  

6) Planning.  
   Vibe-coding may (and often should) use an evolving or even rigid blueprint — 
   but only if it serves the vibe.  
   Planning is encouraged when it helps guide the work or keep your co-viber  
   (AI or human) in check. Sketches, guardrails, architecture notes, checklists —
   especially to keep an LLM co-pilot in check. Plan as needed to protect
   correctness, safety, and developer sanity.  Over-planning that kills the vibe
   is prohibited.

7) AI Co-Viber.  
   LLMs and AI tools are welcome, but vibes over hallucinations.  
   Keep receipts (prompts, diffs), review outputs like a responsible human,  
   and steer the model as much as needed to serve the vibe.

8) AIA Attribution.
   Mark AI involvement with an [AIA-style attribution](https://aiattribution.github.io/) 
   badge or statement.  
   Example: `AIA Human-AI blend, Human-initiated, Reviewed, ChatGPT 5 v1.0`
